<td>I have worked in the IT industry for over ten years in the field of Microsoft Windows Infrastructure, but as I was self-taught, I came to feel that I did not have the base academic understanding of computers that would allow me to develop my technical skills as far as I wanted.  It was at this point that I became interested in Computer Science and decided to pursue a Computer Science education.</td>

<td>I think it is cool that the Human Brain Project is developing a computer simulation that will be able to model a complete mouse brain.
I think it is cool that new networking protocols are being developed to facilitate extending the Internet to other planets in our solar system.  This is called Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN).
I think it is cool that CERN is able to store 25 Petabytes of data each year and will have to store even more as the experiments at the LHC are modified.

<td>Why choose computer science: I was thinking that computers are powerful calculators, while humans have all sorts of weakness in logical processes. Humans have the innovation but their 'hardware' is not as good. Combining human ideas and computing power, we could create knowledge, or get closer to higher powers? It does seems an empty fantasy though when I look back to it...

<td>I was always a person with a variety of interests and it was vital for me to choose a path that will combine my love for art and technology. I believe that computer science does it: it is apparently a process of creating something and there are no limits if one is skilled enough. 
I got interested in computer science when I started my computer science module in high school: I was fascinated by the fact that I can control a machine and make it fulfil tasks and since that time I've started to learn about the world of computer and technology, ascertaning myself even more that this is what I want to dedicate my life to. I've started to develop my programming skills, read webpages and books about technology and computers and by the time I had to apply for university there was no doubts that my choice is right.
Apart from computer science, I am really keen on art: cinematography, music, photography. That is why, again, I chose to do computer science, as now worlds of art and technology are firmly connected and technology is used to create pieces of art. Also, I am interested in traveling and learning about new cultures. </td>

<td>1) I think that it is really cool that now, with the use of technology, people around the world can connect more easily: I remember that only around 5 years ago it was much harder to stay in touch with family and friends while you're away or with people you met on your journeys. Now, you can see people trough skype (or facetime), share pictures and messages through different messengers and always have a feeling that you are there next to the people you care about and want to share your life events with.
2) I also think that virtual reality is really cool: now people can create whole new worlds and only imagination is the limit.
3) And AI is pretty sick...I mean robots, come on, how cool is that?</td>

<td>1) How can I protect my personal information online even though I have to agree to T&C on many websites that allow them to use my personal data?
2) Is it possible to make computers feel emotions just like humans?
3) Really, I'm open to learning new things and can't wait to get as much information about computer science as possible :) </td>

<td>As I have mentioned before, I am interested in art, so I was thinking about choosing some multimedia modules on my third year. I don't know yet how is it possible to create audio, virtual reality and graphics with the help of computers, but I am very excited to learn about it. Plus, I think that AI is going to be a huge thing soon, so, maybe, in two yers it will be my choice as well. Or, perhaps, I can combine both as computer science opens unlimited opportunities for creativity and personal growth so you can combine many fields and paths to make your own, original one.</td>

<td>Computer Science has got a bright future in the industry and therefore a degree in computer science will allow me to explore my strengths in the IT sector whether it deals with programming or hardware related or logic, furthermore computer science is directly related to fullfilling the needs of the people in the market hence making a direct impact into lives of individuals is one of the key things i've wanted to do in my life. Got interested into computers back at high school when it seemed like a genius machine that could solve a wide variety of problems in a short time. Umh.. nope not really interested in anything else except computers maybe my passion for a mathematics related course is another option i should give a thought to.</td>

The idea to work on understanding artificial intelligence, communication, cognition and the basic questions of technology makes me really motivated to start this new course of study . I really think that computer science is actually one of the few academic disciplines that truly embodies the future .
Nowadays almost everything is made by a computer , even if we don't know that ,  and i would like to learn how is it possible without the help of a human mind . Computers are a very big part of my life ;  from everyday work to research or study ,  so during the next three years i'm strongly motivated to understand each single part of it .

<td>I was first interested in the course 'computer science' when my brother first studied it at Queen Mary, he often used to explain what he learnt in the lectures when he came back home, this was an interesting concept for me and I was intrigued by what he was learning, feeling that it is the correct course for me. My brother, 
 
I decided to study computer science (with industrial experience) over many other IT courses that the university provide is due to the fact that the course is more based towards 'problem solving' which I believe is one of my stronger attributes. I also know, from looking at the modules that the main focus of the course is to learn programming and becoming a good programmer. Again, this is something I wish to learn and feel that I can thrive in. 
Therefore the main reason why I decided to study computer science was more peer/family based, but I also enjoy the concepts of the course and enjoy learning new attributes regarding computer systems. </td>

<td>1) I think it's cool we can play simulation games such as football, which have realistic elements such as ball control, passing etc. and all of this can be implemented within one game (such as Fifa 14)
2) I think it's cool that we can now upgrade our own computers without having to buy a whole new system, specific parts can be upgraded without having to change the whole system, thus saving money.
3) i think it's cool we can now watch and upload our own videos to hosting sites. Sharing our views and experience, thus encouraging freedom of speech.</td>

<td>a) How is it possible that the system can recongnise each time a part is upgraded and act accordingly?
b) How is it possible that the trackpad can recongnise our finger but not if we are wearing gloves? 
c) How is it possible that devices are getting smaller, but working faster and better then the larger systems?</td>

<td>There are various concepts I would like to learn in computer science:
I would firstly want to learn various programming languages, we are already learning Java but I would like to learn a new programming language such as Python. 
I would also like to learn more in depth, regarding sensors and finger print touch etc. For example, a track pad, how does it recognise my finger is moving left, right etc? What sensors are working together and how. 
Another prospect I would like to learn is how to create software, for example how is the process created? I have a rough idea of different people given different jobs in a software development team, but what is the core and what is the end? 
I would like to know how companies thoroughly test each system they create? If the system fails, who fixes it and do they have a time limit? 
Lastly, I would like to learn more in depth about operating systems, the history of them. How they were created, who invented the GUI and why? What was the logic behind this? Why were more operating systems created? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each operating system and what operating systems are better for which audience.

<td>from a very young age, I was exposed to computers and their inner workings, and have always found it fascinating how such complex machines can be constructed and controlled. What I find truly awesome about the subject is that the core concepts may remain the same over decades, but the machines we use in our daily lives are likely to have changed completely within 5 years - for example augmented reality devices such as Google Glass and 3D projectors etc.</td>

<td>a) I think it's cool that computing has become ubiquitous with day to day life - and that when I want to use a word like ubiquitous it takes around 10 seconds to find an online thesaurus to make sure I've got the right definition.
b) I think it's cool that computing is one of the only subjects where the landscape of the subject is changed rapidly. Other subjects such as Physics and Chemistry are all building on top of well established principles, and until one new groundbreaking scientist comes along with a new idea these topics will remain more or less constant.

d) I think it's cool that the internet allows us to share knowledge so easily and that devices such as smartphones allow this to blend seamlessly into our everyday lives - for example, if I want to know when the next train is before I get to the station I simply go to a webpage that tells me.</td>

<td>a)</td>

<td>How do we overcome the problems of memory and time complexity in programs, and turn NP hard problems into easily solvable problems. Problems such as timetabling and the travelling salesman problem which could have amazingly useful practical applications that we currently solve by taking shortcuts, using pre-computed values and in some cases by getting a rough solution and then improving it by hand - is it possible to change the way we program and the architecture of computers so that these problems are no longer NP hard, but actually are easy enough to solve and compute on a normal desktop computer.
Without simply using more powerful machines and parallel processing, is it possible to solve integer factorisation? The security implications would be huge, but the entire system is only feasible for creating digital signatures because no-one has found a way to effectively solve the problem. Quantum computing has made some progress towards this, but only in the sense that due to their nature quantum computers are able to brute force their way through every possibile solution at once - hardly an elegant solution. I want to know whether mathematical problems such as this, from which we've built a lot of security systems that are only secure because there is no easy solution yet, can be solved - without simply building bigger and faster machines to the point where the inefficient method only takes a fraction of a second.</td>

<td>from a very young age, I was exposed to computers and their inner workings, and have always found it fascinating how such complex machines can be constructed and controlled. What I find truly awesome about the subject is that the core concepts may remain the same over decades, but the machines we use in our daily lives are likely to have changed completely within 5 years - for example augmented reality devices such as Google Glass and 3D projectors etc.</td>

a) I think it's cool that computing has become ubiquitous with day to day life - and that when I want to use a word like ubiquitous it takes around 10 seconds to find an online thesaurus to make sure I've got the right definition.
b) I think it's cool that computing is one of the only subjects where the landscape of the subject is changed rapidly. Other subjects such as Physics and Chemistry are all building on top of well established principles, and until one new groundbreaking scientist comes along with a new idea these topics will remain more or less constant.
c) I think it's cool that I am now able to - with great ease - have a video conference call with my mum back at home and my sister in France, without having to use any 'specialised' programs.
d) I think it's cool that the internet allows us to share knowledge so easily and that devices such as smartphones allow this to blend seamlessly into our everyday lives - for example, if I want to know when the next train is before I get to the station I simply go to a webpage that tells me.
